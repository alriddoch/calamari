	* src/calamari.c: Remove all traces of the hard coded block.

2006-03-03  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/calamari.c: Remove hard coded block. Re-work collision detection
	  to work on the real shape, rather than the previous proof-of-concept
	  code.

2006-03-02  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/calamari.c: Enclose fixed tagged block rendering in a push pop
	  to prevent it from messing up the real blocks. Fix a number of
	  types when determining the offset for attached blocks.

2006-03-02  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/calamari.c: Add structure to store data about arbitrary blocks
	  around the terrain. Add normals to the cubes. Draw blocks around
	  the grid, detect if they are picked up, and then draw them attached
	  to the calamari.

2006-03-02  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/calamari.c: Remove debug output.

2006-03-01  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/calamari.c: Enable normalize so lighting looks right. Fix Z
	  offset of cube when it gets picked up.

2006-03-01  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* calamari.c: Detect if calamari is braking hard, and stop rotation
	  if it is. Fix pickup radius to be dependent on size of calamari.
	  Slow done rate of size increase.

2006-02-28  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/quaternion.h, src/quaternion.cpp: Add quaternion invert function.

	* src/calamari.c: Add proof of concept code to pick up a block and
	  attach to the calamari.

2006-02-28  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/quaternion.h, src/quaternion.c: Refactor quaternion rotation
	  function to return its result rather than acting on the argument.
	  Add implementation of quaternion multiplication, and use it
	  to do the rotation. Implement creating a rotmatrix from a quaternion.

	* src/calamari.c: Add lighting. Implement rotating the calamari as
	  it rolls using a quaternion to store its orientation.

2006-02-28  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/quaternion.h: Add prototypes for quaternion functions.

	* src/calamari.c: Add a quaternion for the calamari orientation,
	  and add experimental code to modify it as the ball rolls.

	* src/quaternion.c, src/quaternion.h: Implement some quaternion
	  operations.

	* src/calamari.c: Remove some debug output.

2006-02-27  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/calamari.c: Implement controls in new logic, and delete old
	  logic, implementing both forward and reverse turning while moving,
	  and frame rate independant rotating.

2006-02-26  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/calamari.c: Modify key handlers because certain combinations
	  cannot be detected on some keyboards. Use a single keypress to
	  flip the camera view instead, and add the code that will handle
	  this.

2006-02-26  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/calamari.c: Rename control flags to by synbolic of the keys
	  function, not the currently hardcoded binding. Add stub logic
	  for handling all the cases that can occur in the input system.

2006-02-25  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/calamari.c: Get rid of the C++isms. Add code to display the
	  size of the calamari.

2006-02-25  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/calamari.c: Convert to nice
	  simple shiny C for the code.

2006-02-25  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/calamari.cpp: Modify camera_pos function so that calamari
	  remains the same orientation relative to the world when the
	  camera rotates around it. Modify update() so it takes the time
	  delta as an argument, and make all the physics calculations
	  relative to frame time. Implement world scale factor, and make
	  it go up linearly with time to verify function.

2006-02-25  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* src/calamari.cpp: Add input processing to handle the state of the
	  tank drive keys, and implement an update function to update
	  the position of the calamari based on input controls.

2006-02-25  Al Riddoch  <alriddoch@zepler.org>

	* Update name of package in all build files, and remove irrelevant
	  extra copies of the source.
