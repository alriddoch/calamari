	* src/calamari.cpp: Modify camera_pos function so that calamari
	  remains the same orientation relative to the world when the
	  camera rotates around it. Modify update() so it takes the time
	  delta as an argument, and make all the physics calculations
	  relative to frame time. Implement world scale factor, and make
	  it go up linearly with time to verify function.

	* src/calamari.cpp: Add input processing to handle the state of the
	  tank drive keys, and implement an update function to update
	  the position of the calamari based on input controls.

	* Update name of package in all build files, and remove irrelevant
	  extra copies of the source.

	* src/calamari.cpp: Re-work camera code, and add in basic sphere for
	  view calibration.
